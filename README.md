# WebPort

WebPort is a web app that serves as both an introduction and a portfolio for myself.

It was designed with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), built with [React](https://react.dev/), and deployed using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Features

Clicking on the question mark on any page will reveal a help modal that automatically navigates to the relevant section for the active page. The modal shows the user, ways in which they are able to interact with the web application.

The backgrounds for the home page and the contact card are draggable along the x-axis.

Clicking a flashcard will flip it. The flashcards loop through an array, starting with the description, and then followed by images/gifs.

The sprite has multiple inputs: arrow keys to move, click to loop through different sprite images, double tap r to reset the spriteâ€™s location.

Clicking either email on the contact page will copy it to the clipboard.

Clicking on any of the table cells will reveal a pop up modal with the respective text, except in a larger font.
